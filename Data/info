This consisits of the dataset used for developing this heart disease prediction model.

<br>
The dataset provided consists of 14 cardiovascular attributes for patients, with a binary target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.
Key attributes include age, sex, chest pain type (cp), resting blood pressure (trestbps), cholesterol level (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), resting electrocardiographic results (restecg), 
maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), exercise-induced angina (exang), ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak), the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope), 
number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ca), and a categorical variable for thalassemia (thal).
The target variable, where 1 indicates heart disease and 0 indicates no heart disease, provides a clear binary classification problem. 
Observations suggest that a higher frequency of patients with heart disease (target=1) is correlated with certain factors such as higher cholesterol levels, 
elevated resting blood pressure, the presence of chest pain, and higher maximum heart rate achieved. Furthermore, attributes like exercise-induced angina 
and higher oldpeak values are more prevalent in patients with heart disease, suggesting these factors could be significant indicators. 
This dataset can be instrumental in building predictive models to identify individuals at risk of heart disease based on these medical and physiological parameters.
